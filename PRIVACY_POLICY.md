# Privacy Policy for PDFTalk

**Last updated: January 14, 2026**

## Overview

PDFTalk ("the App") is a PDF to speech converter application developed by Asare. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

PDFTalk is designed with your privacy in mind. The App:

- Does **NOT** collect personal data
- Does **NOT** require user registration or accounts
- Does **NOT** track your location
- Does **NOT** access your contacts, camera, or microphone
- Does **NOT** contain advertisements
- Does **NOT** use analytics or tracking services
- Does **NOT** transmit any data over the internet

## How the App Works

PDFTalk operates entirely on your device:

1. **PDF Files**: When you select a PDF file, it is processed locally on your device to extract text. The PDF content is cached temporarily in the app's private storage for playback purposes only.

2. **Text-to-Speech**: The App uses your device's built-in text-to-speech engine to read PDF content aloud. No audio is recorded or transmitted.

3. **Preferences**: Your settings (such as theme preference, speech rate, and pitch) are stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences and are never transmitted externally.

## Data Storage

All data used by PDFTalk is stored locally on your device:

- Temporary PDF cache files (in app's private cache directory)
- Extracted text sections (in app's private files directory)
- User preferences (theme, voice settings)

This data is only accessible to the PDFTalk app and is automatically deleted when you uninstall the App or clear the app's data.

## Permissions

PDFTalk requests only the permissions necessary for its core functionality:

- **Storage Access**: To read PDF files you select from your device

The App does not request any other permissions.

## Third-Party Services

PDFTalk does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

The App uses the following open-source libraries:
- PDFBox Android (Apache License 2.0) - for PDF text extraction
- AndroidX libraries (Apache License 2.0) - for app functionality

These libraries operate locally and do not transmit data.

## Children's Privacy

PDFTalk does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
